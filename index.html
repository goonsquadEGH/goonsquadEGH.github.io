By clicking this link you've entered into an agreement with me.

I've spent far too long in the confines of this abyss. Lock your doors for it won't be long

<p align="left"><font face="Arial"><b>There's only one way you can stop all this. 
You must solve this riddle: 

I rise before the world begins,
In quiet vessels, I start my spin.
Guided by hands both firm and sure,
I vanish when the moment’s pure.

I come without a sound to make,
But stir the air with every wake.
I circle and swirl, but I won’t stay,
A fleeting presence, swept away.

I walk with the tired, lead them through,
In silence or motion, I carry you.
Though you may find me in the dawn,
I disappear when the day is drawn.

In the night or morning’s first light,
I await the one who seeks respite.
	
What am I?

Deliver your answer to these coordinates: 
51°27'02.0"N 5°52'20.9"E before the Spring Equinox and consider 
this agreement fulfilled. 

Then I will never bother you again.
If you fail to complete this task within the given time, 
then expect my arrival on the next night at 3:00
