<p align="left"><font face="Arial"><b>Just as he thought his nightmare was over, 
Christopher heard a crashing thud above him and saw a large, three-fingered hand 
with scales and long claws reach over his windshield. Another hand was trying to 
pry open his drivers side door. Christopher, now petrified and scared for his 
life, swerved the vehicle on the road and the creature suddenly fell off. He 
didn't know what kind of animal ran on two legs and could catch up with his car, 
which was traveling at a relatively high speed. He had managed to get away and 
that's all that mattered.</b></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial"><b>When Christopher arrived at home shaking 
and crying, his father settled him down and Christopher began to tell his 
parents about what had happened. His dad knew that his son wasn't usually an 
imaginative storyteller, and Christopher's highly emotional state compelled him 
to believe that Christopher did, in fact, see something highly unusual. </b>

When Lee County Sheriff Liston Truesdale heard about what had occurred to Christopher 
Davis, he interviewed him and asked Christopher if he would be willing to take a 
lie detector test. Liston figured that if Christopher was really making up a 
story for attention, the idea of taking a lie detector test would make him 
retract his story. To Liston's surprise, Christopher happily agreed to be 
tested, adding that he was sure of what happened and of what he had encountered.</font></b></p>
